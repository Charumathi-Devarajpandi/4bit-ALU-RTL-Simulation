# 4-bit ALU RTL Design & Simulation

This project showcases the design and simulation of a **4-bit Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)** using **Verilog HDL**, verified through **ModelSim**. The ALU supports basic arithmetic and logical operations and is functionally validated using a custom testbench and waveform analysis.

---

##  Project Overview

- ## Designed a 4-bit ALU supporting:
  - Addition
  - Subtraction
  - Bitwise AND, OR
  - Bitwise NOT
- Simulated using ModelSim with thorough waveform verification
- Focus on RTL design principles, modular coding, and test-driven verification
